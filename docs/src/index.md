Overview
--------

The Power Market Tool [(POMATO)](https://github.com/richard-weinhold/pomato) aims to enable research
and analyses of modern real-world electricity markets in the context of the physical transmission
system and its secure operation. To analyze relevant market and operational processes POMATO
provides: Simultaneous zonal market clearing and nodal power flow computation, a scalable and fast
SCOPF algorithm, and risk-aware optimal power flow via chance constraints. All optimization features
rely on Julia/JuMP, leveraging its accessibility, computational performance, and solver interfaces.

This repository holds these features as a individual julia package for easier maintenance, testing
and documentation. However it is eventually embedded in a Python front-end, providing flexible and
easily maintainable data processing and user interaction features and is not meant so be used on its
own. Please see the corresponding publication and the [(POMATO
repository)](https://github.com/richard-weinhold/pomato) for further information.

Installation
------------

This package is meant to be used in conjunction with the python
[POMATO](https://github.com/richard-weinhold/pomato) model, which embeds its features and installs
it automatically. 

Stand alone usage is possible, however specificity formatted data. 

Installation can be done directly from git via: 

```
] add https://github.com/richard-weinhold/MarketModel
```

or from a local clone/fork of the repository via: 

```
] add develop --local path-to-repository
```

The recommended julia version is 1.5, although compatibility is given for version >= 1.3, but not
continuously tested.
