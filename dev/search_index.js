To analyze relevant market and operational processes POMATO provides: Simultaneous zonal market clearing and nodal power flow computation, a scalable and fast SCOPF algorithm, and risk-aware optimal power flow via chance constraints. All optimization features rely on Julia/JuMP, leveraging its accessibility, computational performance, and solver interfaces.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introducion","title":"Introducion","text":"This repository holds these features as a individual julia package for easier maintenance, testing and documentation. However it is eventually embedded in a Python front-end, providing flexible and easily maintainable data processing and user interaction features and is not meant so be used on its own.
